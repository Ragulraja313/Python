Lines and Indentation
Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation. The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the block must be indented the same amount. 

Eg:  



Multiline statements
Statements in Python typically end with a new line. We can write multi line statements using several techniques such as
Backslash
Parentheses.
Brackets
Curly Braces

Quotations in Python
Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string literals.

Eg:

word = 'word' 

sentence = "This is a sentence." 

paragraph = """This is a paragraph. It is made up of multiple lines and sentences."""

Comments in Python

A comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the Python source code. A hash sign (#) that is not inside a string literal begins a comment. All characters after the # and up to the end of the physical line are part of the comment.

Eg:

# First comment 
print ("Hello, World!") # Second comment

Triple-quoted string is also ignored by Python interpreter and can be used as a multiline comments:
''' 
This is a 
multiline comment. 
'''




Python User Input:
Python allows for user input. That means we are able to ask the user for input.   
Eg:


val = input("Enter your value: ")
print(val)
